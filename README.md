# Ember Demo Components Addon

This repo is a proof of concept for consuming shareable addon components into other Karbon FE applications.

## How to consume in other apps.

Coming soon.

## Running / Development

* `npm start` to spin up the dummy test application at [http://localhost:4400](http://localhost:4400).

4400 has been chosen as our app is probably running somewhere in the background, and 4300 is probably used as part of your own experiments. 4400 won't upset other stuff.

### Running Tests

* `npm test`
* `npm run test-ui` for the gui version

### Deploying

Coming soon.
